<h3>How do we create a map of the connections between the domains of food and climate change?</h3>

<p>We need to cut through overload/specificity of narratives and data to:</p>
<ul>
<li>illuminate connections
<li> identify problems
<li> offer suggestions
</ul>
<p>Our API will allow us to start illuminating connections in food & climate change scenarios by storing relationships between the domains of Food, Water, Policy, Fuel, People, and Land. We imagine people working on real scenarios describing their work within these domains using very basic parameters. For example:</p>

<p>What foods are included in the scenarios that you are working on?</p>

<p>How much water is at stake? What is it used for?</p>

<p>What environments are you working in? How would you categorize them?</p>

<p>Who eats this food? How much do they eat?</p>

<p>What policies govern production/consumption? Are they local, state, national? </p>

<p>How much fuel is needed? What is used for? How much fuel is saved?</p>

<p>These questions will not only simply populate a database, but also create connections between scenarios. For example, there are not many types of water, so all scenarios will link to water. Their consumption can be represented in any number of ways, the API will allow artists/designers to access the connections.</p>

<p>The goal is to move quickly from making the connections to showing areas where individuals, organizations, etc. can make small changes and have a systemic impact.</p>
